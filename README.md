It is a prototype based model that makes direct connection between food donors and those in
need of donation, this app was designed with the thought of providing delicious, decent quality
and safe to consume food to those who are in serious need of it.
The app is designed to be user friendly, featuring in-app messaging, push notifications, and a
comprehensive set of food safety guidelines. Furthermore, a user rating and review system
promotes community trust, allowing users to provide feedback on their donation or pickup
experiences. Scheduling and reminders enhance the coordination of food pickups, while an
analytics dashboard provides metrics on successful donations, food waste reduction, and
overall community impact.
